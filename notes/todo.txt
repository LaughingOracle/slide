note: average 1.5mb -> 300kb
      batch ~600mb/500 png -> sequential 300kb/1 jpg (~150mb total)

before: all image per tv were loaded for every time /slide/{tv} is called, an instant spike of ~600mb
now: image is called when it's about to be showed, 300kb/10 sec (<- 10 sec is the preconfigured slide delay)
